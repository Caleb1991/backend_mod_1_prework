## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

The Superlearner Article articulated a swath of fantastic strategizes and characteristics essential to being a continuing learner. While, at times, it did feel like a "Forbes' five things person A does every morning" article, I still think it was successful in its intent. The ideas of taking care of the brain and taking short breaks every ~50 minutes are things I would love to implement, as well as reading more. I currently continue to believe I can learn and unlearn and relearn, but I can always be better at it. I wouldn't add anything to the article, I think it exhibits content the average reader wouldn't often think of.

Interpolation is putting a variable or variables inside of string. For example:

1. What method is used to get input from a user?

gets.chomp
