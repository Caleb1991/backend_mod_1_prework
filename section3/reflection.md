## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
<p> Resonating with me was the idea that no one is born an expert at their craft. They got to where they are through hours upon hours of practice. In addition, the idea of seeking out failure is a tantalizing one to me. It really puts on its head the perpetuated idea that we must 'fake it until we make it'.</p>

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
<p> While I perceive myself as one that seeks failure, I don't know that I always put it into practice. While failure is not something that I dwell on, I don't know that I am constantly seeking it out. However, I love setting up practice schedules, and it is one of my strengths in regards to the growth mindset.</p>

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?
<p> A has is a data storage that assigns both keys and values. It is unordered but has the benefit of being able to call upon things based upon their key. An array on the other hand is ordered, however it does not have both a key and value, it seems only to have a value.</p>

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
`pet_store = {dog_food: 13, cat_food: 12, chew_toys: 5, squeak_toys:7}`

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
`states.values[1]`

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?
`keys = states.keys values = states.values`

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?
<p> A hash could be used to contain a multitude of things. One impractical method could be 'characters that appeared in this episode of Ninja Turtles where the value 0 means they did not and 1 means they did'. Hashes are great in that they expand on part of what arrays were doing, however they don't do it in an ordered manner. I don't think one is better than the other, it's just a matter of one may be better for a certain situation.</p>

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
<p> I'm curious about additional ways to call on values or keys without using 'states.values[0]'. In working through hashes.rb I attempted to call upon a key by its 'p "there are #{zoo['penguin']} penguins in the zoo"' and it continually displayed a blank space where I wanted the value to be present. I'm certain this is error on my entering of code, but I am still curious about other ways to call on keys/values. </p>
